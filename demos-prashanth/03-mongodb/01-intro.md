## MongoDB
- Not structured data - not relational
    - row (all fields exist) <=> document (unstructured - one of the documents may have one field value, and another may not have)
    - Supports multi-valued attributes (array, objects as value)
    - Example
        - Instead of storing customer addresses in a separate table, we can (and would usually) store addresses in the customer collection (i.e. table) itself
        - This way a lot of joins are avoided
- Does not use SQL for querying - instead uses plain JS methods for querying
- Built for scaling (NoSQL DBs)
- Terminology
    - Row <=> Document
    - Table <=> Collection
- Documents are stored in extended JSON format (JS objects) -> JSON text is converted to a binary format (BSON - Binary JSON)
